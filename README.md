# FIP Scaffolding
By David Gonzales

## This repo is my FIP Scaffolding assignment. The contents include: 
(No Folder)
An age restriction page
An index page.

(Assets)
XD Wireframes
Text Document Outline
Webpages I drew inspiration from

(CSS)
A CSS main page involving CSS styling
A CSS grid page for grid styling

I built mobile-first, using the class examples and HW2 as a framework to build from.
It reacts as expected from mobile, to tablet, and desktop.
I have validated the code through validator.w3.org
